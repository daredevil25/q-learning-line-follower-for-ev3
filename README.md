# LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Line Following with Q-Learning

This project implements a Q-learning algorithm for line following on the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robot using MicroPython. The Q-learning approach enables the robot to learn and optimize its path following behavior by considering rewards assigned to each action.

## Usage

1. Upload the MicroPython code to your EV3 brick.
2. Execute the code to initiate the Q-learning process for line following.
